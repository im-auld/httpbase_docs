Example Client
==============

Using the  API provided by `JSONPlaceholder`_ here is a small example client demonstrating some of the core concepts of
``httpbase``.

This example is runnable once ``httpbase`` is installed. Note that the API provided by JSONPlaceholder doesn't actually
store posted data so you won't be able to get your new post back. You will know it is working however by the status
code of the response.
